# (Microphone, Accessibility) survive rebuilds. Ad-hoc signing ("-") changes the
# code hash every build, which resets those grants; a fixed, trusted cert keeps the
# bundle's Designated Requirement constant, so you grant once.
#
# The identity lives in its own keychain (talkty-dev) with a throwaway password, so
# *signing* is non-interactive. The one step that needs your password is trusting
# the cert for code signing — macOS guards the trust store by design.
